What is Nanook table?

It is a processor which reads Spreadsheets to defined test cases
and test data. It processes the sheets and generates test cases and test data.
It helps you to recreate the test cases and test data while you working on the
specification of test cases in the spreadsheet files.

The spreadsheets help to keep the overview of the test cases and the
test coverage. But is is hard to change the tests and update all the test data of
you test cases. This is where Nanook-Table comes in.
