== Execute Section
This section gives you the possibility to switch single test cases on/off.
If the section does not exist, all test cases will be executed. If the section
exists, only the marked test cases will be executed.

Add a new row in row '3' of the Excel sheet.

[cols="1,3,6",options="header"]

As all the test cases have a 'T' in their column, all the test cases are executed. If you change
some of them to 'F', then these test cases will not be executed.
