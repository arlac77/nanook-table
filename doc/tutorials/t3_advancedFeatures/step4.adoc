== Using References
References are a way to split complex equivalence class tables in
a bunch of smaller tables. Or to reference a complete record which exists
also. In the previous example we have added a 'friend email' field.
The email is generated as expected. But what if our system needs to have the
full record before you can enter an email of a friend. So the system will proof
that the email exists. In the test data we need to create an existing record
first before we can enter the 'friend email'.

To solve this we can use the reference. So let's change the generator call for
the friend email into a reference call.

From:

----
gen:1:generatorPerson:email
----

to:

----
ref::sheet1:email:friend
----

.Syntax of the 'ref' command
----
ref:<instanceId suffix>:<sheet name>:<field name>:<test case name>
----

Also changed the text case names.

We have now one test case called 'TC1' and one test case 'friend'. For this test case we have removed the
friend email field. Because if we leave the 'x' here we have a recursion.

Start the generator and have a look at the generated data.

{
  "tableName": "sheet1",
  "name": "TC1.1",
  "data": {
    "sheet1": {
      "1946ecc3-750f-4863-808e-2f5d83ccf31e": {

        "first name": "Said",
        "last name": "Lutje",
        "email": "Said.Lutje@gum.org",
        "friend email": "Ian.Meloni@foo.bar"
                        <2>
      },

        "last name": "Meloni",
        "email": "Ian.Meloni@foo.bar"
      }
    }
  },
  "instanceId": "1946ecc3-750f-4863-808e-2f5d83ccf31e",
                        <4>
  "callTree": {}
}
----
<1> The main data set. It is the same instanceId as the id in the property
'instanceId' (see mark 4)
<2> The friend email. This email is the same email coming from the second
record which is generated with a new instanceId.
<3> The new record with a complete person data set from which the email
was taken.
