== Using References
References are a way to split complex equivalence class tables into
a bunch of smaller tables or to reference a complete, existing record. In the previous example we have added a 'friend email' field.
The email is generated as expected. But what if our system needs to have the
full record before we can enter an email of a friend, so that it can proof
that the email exists? In the test data we need to create an existing record
first, before we can enter the 'friend email'.

To solve this we can use the reference. So let's change the generator call for
the friend email to a reference call.

From:

----
gen:1:generatorPerson:email
----

to:

----
ref::sheet1:email:friend
----

.Syntax of the 'ref' command
----
ref:<instanceId suffix>:<sheet name>:<field name>:<test case name>
----

We also change the test case name.

We now have one test case called 'TC1' and one test case called 'friend'. For this test case we have removed the
friend email field, because if we would leave the 'x' here we would have a recursion.

Start the generator and have a look at the generated data.

{
  "tableName": "sheet1",
  "name": "TC1.1",
  "data": {
    "sheet1": {
      "1946ecc3-750f-4863-808e-2f5d83ccf31e": {
                        <1>
        "first name": "Said",
        "last name": "Lutje",
        "email": "Said.Lutje@gum.org",
        "friend email": "Ian.Meloni@foo.bar"
                        <2>
      },

        "last name": "Meloni",
        "email": "Ian.Meloni@foo.bar"
      }
    }
  },
  "instanceId": "1946ecc3-750f-4863-808e-2f5d83ccf31e",
                        <4>
  "callTree": {}
}
----
<1> The main data set. It has the same instanceId as the id in the property
'instanceId' (see mark 4)
<2> The friend email. This email is the same email coming from the second
record which is generated with a new instanceId.
<3> The new record with a complete person data set from which the email
was taken.
