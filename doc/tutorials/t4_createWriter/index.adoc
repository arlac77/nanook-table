== Create your own writer

This chapter will show how to create your own writer and how to make use of them. For this tutorial
the writer should generate a CSV file of the created test data. The data is written on a per
test case basis. If you need one file containing all the data of all test cases, it is a good
practice to aggregate the file later on, shortly before execution, so that you can store the generated
data and decide later which test cases to include in the next run, or if you would
like to retest only some of the tests. So I recommend to split the data per test cases.
