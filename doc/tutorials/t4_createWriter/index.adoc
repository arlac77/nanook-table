== Create your own writer

This chapter shows how to create your own writer and make use of them. For this tutorial
the writer should generate a CSV file of the created test data. The data is written on a per
test case basis. If you need one file containing all the data of all test cases, it is a good
practice to aggregate the file later on. Short before execution. So you can store the generated
data and decide later which test cases to include into the next run. Also if you would
like to retest only some of the tests. So I recommend to split the data per test cases.
